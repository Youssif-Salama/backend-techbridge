# 🔒 Security Guidelines for Tech Bridge

This document outlines security measures and best practices for handling sensitive cases in the **Tech Bridge** platform, ensuring data integrity, user privacy, and system protection.

## 1️⃣ Authentication & Authorization
✅ Use **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for authentication.
✅ Store passwords securely using **bcrypt** with a strong salt.
✅ Implement **role-based access control (RBAC)** to restrict access to sensitive routes.
✅ Invalidate tokens on logout and enforce token expiration.

## 2️⃣ Data Protection
✅ Use **HTTPS** to encrypt data in transit.
✅ Store sensitive information securely using **environment variables** (`.env`).
✅ Avoid exposing sensitive data in API responses.

## 3️⃣ File Upload Security
✅ Validate file types and sizes using **Multer**.
✅ Store uploaded files securely and avoid direct public access.
✅ Scan uploaded files for potential threats.

## 4️⃣ API Security
✅ Implement **rate limiting** to prevent brute-force attacks.
✅ Use **CORS** to restrict unauthorized cross-origin requests.
✅ Sanitize and validate all user inputs with **Joi** to prevent **SQL/NoSQL injection**.

## 5️⃣ Email Security
✅ Use **Nodemailer** with secure authentication.
✅ Prevent email enumeration by using generic error messages.
✅ Verify user emails before allowing account-related actions.

## 6️⃣ Session & Cookies
✅ Avoid storing sensitive information in client-side cookies.
✅ Use **httpOnly** and **Secure** flags for session cookies.
✅ Implement **CSRF protection** where applicable.

## 7️⃣ Logging & Monitoring
✅ Log authentication attempts and suspicious activities.
✅ Implement **real-time monitoring** for security events.
✅ Alert administrators of potential security breaches.

## 8️⃣ Database Security
✅ Use **MongoDB access controls** and avoid public databases.
✅ Regularly back up the database securely.
✅ Limit database queries to prevent **Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks**.

## 🚀 Reporting Security Issues
